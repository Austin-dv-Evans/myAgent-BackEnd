MyAgent

MyAgent is a application developed for musicians to help eliminate the need for a booking agent. 


In these tough times, musicians need to be keeping every cent they earn, which means booking their own gigs, staying organized and having access to the proper forms and paperwork that goes into each and every performance. That is why MyAgent is here. Track your upcoming gigs, add a gig to your upcoming gigs and have direct access to; performance agreements, band agreements, and rider contracts.
